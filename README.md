<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold">Project Description</h2>
<p align="center">
Unfortunately, many people complain they don't have enough time in their day-to-day lives to read.
It’ll feel difficult at first to make reading part of your daily habit, especially if you aren’t used to it already. But with patience and consistency, you’ll remember that you love to read & update yourselves, and forget about all the reasons you made excuses not to.
Always use to navigate through different platforms, to read vary news.
</p>
<p align="center">
This project is originated from <a href="https://github.com/devstrons">DEVSTRONS'</a>, a student-run Open source/ project-based, inclusive & diverse community intending to Learn, Code & Tron (grow). It's an organization bridging a gap between beginners and professionals to provide opportunities/resources to the folks around; in partnership with 10+ developer communities and <a href="https://apacdirectory.hackclub.com/club/devstrons">@hackclub</a>.

  <b>Idea</b><br />
To overcome through this major problem description, we came up with an idea to get the impressive User Interface/ User Experience (UI/UX) for the readers to attract them read daily. Also, readers can find a mixture of all news at one place at a time, just they need to navigate through bars at top. As a developer, we came up with hackers news as well to justify & fulfil the requirements.
